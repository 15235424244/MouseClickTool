# MouseClickTool
## Explanation
Mouse click tool, free to use, open source
## Function Introduction
- It supports left and right mouse clicks. Since I haven't used the scroll wheel to click, I haven't written this function
- Support single-click and double-click
- Supports mouse cursor position clicking and clicking at specified coordinates
- Support the setting of click interval time
- Support the number of repetitions or the duration of clicks
- Support the setting of linked shortcut keys
- Support setting the duration of mouse pressing
- Support setting the start duration before clicking
- When in use, right-click "Administrator Run" to click on certain games
## Q&A
- The game cannot be clicked: Run with administrator privileges
- Setting shortcut keys may not be possible because other hotkeys cannot be set. It's fine to use less frequently used hotkeys instead
- If setting shortcut keys may not be able to read the keyboard, try another key
## 开发使用语言、工具
- Develop and use languages and tools
- Development tools: IDEA, Launch4j (jar to generate exe file)
## Follow-up
- Functions may be added based on usage
- Friends who want to develop additional functions by themselves can download the source code and develop and modify new functions by themselves
